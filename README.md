# iSarcasm-SemEval-2022-Task-6
iSarcasmEval: Intended Sarcasm Detection In English and Arabic

## Files

We included the models of the official final submissions in each subtask along with the corresponding datasets. We splitted the original training datasets into "train" and "validation" splits and we used the offical testing datasets for reporting the results. In the files you can find 5 folders corresponding to the 5 subtasks. Each folder contains the following:

- Training dataset which is based on the "train" split and augmented by external data or by repeting instances.
- Validation dataset which is the "validation" split.
- Tesing dataset which is the official testing dataset.
- Python notebook including the model of the official final submission and can be run directly on the datasets without modification.

All the datasets are processed with the same type of preprocessing.
